## Internity Summer Internship Work
- Contains the work done by me during my Summer Internship with **Internity Foundation in 2019 (June - July)**
- Had an amazing time during my internship and was awarded the 'Best Blogger' and 'Best Intern' title for my work during the internship program.
- During Creat-A-Thon my team 'ERUDITE' came 2nd out of 12 participating teams. We made an Old Car Price predictor by applying Random Forest Regressor to our Dataset.
